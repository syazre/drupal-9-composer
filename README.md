# Composer template for Drupal projects

## Usage

First you need to [install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the [global Composer installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).
You might need to replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` (or similar)
for your setup.

After that you can create the project:

```
composer create-project drupal/recommended-project drupal-9-composer
```

```
cd drupal-9-composer
```


## Database

After that you need to create database on phpmyadmin.
Once the database was created, go to local project directory to install Drupal project.
Eg: http://localhost:8080/drupal-9-composer/web


## Include .gitignore

After Drupal successfully installed, need to include `.gitignore` file to the root folder.

```
# Ignore directories generated by Composer
/drush/contrib/
/vendor/
/web/core/
/web/modules/contrib/
/web/themes/contrib/
/web/profiles/contrib/
/web/libraries/

# Ignore sensitive information
/web/sites/*/settings.php
/web/sites/*/settings.local.php

# Ignore Drupal's file directory
/web/sites/*/files/

# Ignore SimpleTest multi-site environment
/web/sites/simpletest

# Ignore files generated by common IDEs
/.idea/
/.vscode/

# Ignore .env files as they are personal
/.env
```


## Push to Github Repository

Once the `.gitignore` file created, run command below to push the local file to the github repository.


```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/repository-name.git
git push -u origin main
```
